        <p>Today, I went to school. I ate food. Food tastes good. I like things that are good. Lots of things I like are good (actually all of them).  If the things I liked were not good then, I would not like them but things that are bad are not necessarily things I don't like and things that are good are not necessarily things I like. </p>

        <p>Today, I went to school. School is where I went. School, I went today. Who went to school? I went to school. School starts at 9:00. A.M or P.M? School starts at 9:00 A.M because if it started at P.M that wouldn't be good and I would not like that. School lasts for 6 hours. Now you know I go to school or do you? How do you know I've been telling you the truth because I could have been lying. Now you're thinking why would this person have the motive to lie to me. But think about this what would be my motive to tell the truth? I could tell the truth or I could not. Me saying that could have just been to make you think you know who I am because why would I tell private information to a learning website for the public to see.</p>
